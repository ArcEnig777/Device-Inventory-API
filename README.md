# Inventory API

This repository contains the files required to run an API for a file storage. The API retreives file information that is asked by the user via a web interface by communicating with the database to retreive the information

The polished API functionality with error trapping is currently in the API folder. It contains muiltiple security checks to make sure the url cannot be easily tampered to access any sensitive information and is parsed correctly for Curl requests
